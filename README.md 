# Mask Detection and Temperature Measurement

**Created by:** Ahmed Said, Software Engineering

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple mask detection and temperature measurement system using Python and OpenCV. The system uses a pre-trained face detection model to identify faces in real-time through the device's camera. It then simulates temperature measurement and determines whether the person is wearing a mask or not.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

- OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
- NumPy: `pip install numpy`

## How to Use

1. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mask-detection.git
cd mask-detection
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python mask_detection.py
```

4. Use the system:

   - The camera will open, and the system will start detecting faces.
   - Simulated temperature measurement will be displayed along with the mask detection status.
   - Press 'Esc' to exit the application.

## Benefits

- Simple and easy-to-understand code.
- Utilizes pre-trained models for face detection and requires minimal setup.
- Provides a basic example for educational purposes.
- Demonstrates the integration of computer vision for mask detection.

Feel free to customize the code for your specific needs or integrate it into a larger project.
